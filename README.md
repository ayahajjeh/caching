# Caching
`This was one of my coding projects for CS51 Computer Architecture class at Dartmouth College.`

In this project, I gain a deeper understanding of caching by exploring and analyzing how it works for real 32-bit X86-family address traces. I use the following four different implementations:

- direct-mapped
- 2-way set-associative
- 4-way set-associative
- fully associative

Read below for more details about the trace files used, code samples, cache parameters, the simulation output, and my conclusions about the diminishing returns in the relation between associativity increases and performance improvements.
